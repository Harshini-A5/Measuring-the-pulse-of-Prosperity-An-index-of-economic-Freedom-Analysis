lakshmiMeasuring the Pulse of Prosperity: An Index of Economic Freedom Analysis
This repository contains a data analytics project analyzing the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom, which ranks countries on their economic liberty across key pillars like rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets.
​
​

Project Overview
The project visualizes how economic freedom correlates with prosperity indicators such as GDP growth, poverty rates, and corruption levels using interactive Tableau dashboards. Data preparation involved handling null values (via averages or row removal), removing duplicates, and standardizing country identifiers for accurate analysis.
​
​

Key insights reveal that higher economic freedom scores link to improved prosperity, reduced poverty, and lower corruption, with trends observable across regions and historical data.
​

Features
Interactive filters for countries, regions, years, and economic pillars.

Visualizations of index scores vs. development metrics (e.g., GDP per capita, unemployment).
​
​

Dashboard exploring 12 factors grouped into four pillars: Rule of Law (property rights, judicial effectiveness), Government Size (tax burden, spending), Regulatory Efficiency (business, labor, monetary freedom), and Open Markets (trade, investment, financial freedom).
​
